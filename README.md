# ðŸ§  AI Workflow Automation Technical Assessment

**Role**: Sr. Software Engineer â€“ Python and AI Workflow Automation

**Deliverable**: GitHub repo + README

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Simulate a real-world automation task: a junior marketing assistant needs to create a client briefing document from public data using a mix of API integration and AI summarization.

Your task is to build a simple Python automation that fetches company information, organizes it, and produces a ready-to-share report using AI.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scenario

Imagine youâ€™ve joined a team supporting marketing strategy for small businesses. Your colleague needs to create a client research brief quickly and wants a tool that can help automate it.

---

## ðŸ§© What Youâ€™ll Build

Build a simple Python CLI or web script that:

1. Accepts a **company name** or **domain** (e.g., `stripe.com`) as input
2. **Uses a free company info API** to get basic data:
  * Use Clearbit's free Logo & Autocomplete API or [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/api)
  * Optional fallback: **DuckDuckGo**, **Wikipedia**
3. Fetches recent news or mentions:
  * Use the [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) free tier or [Mediastack](https://mediastack.com/) for headlines
  * Filter for recent news related to the company/domain
4. Generates a research brief:
  * Use OpenAI (or any LLM) to write a summary like:
  > "Stripe is a fintech company focused on online payments. Based on recent news, theyâ€™ve recently expanded in the APAC region and launched a new fraud detection product."
  * Include a bullet list of the 3â€“5 most relevant articles with links
5. Exports the output:
  * As a markdown, plain text file, or Google Doc (optional)
  * Structure: Logo + Company Info + AI Summary + Recent Articles
